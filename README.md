Description:
This project aims to evaluate instructor effectiveness using supervised machine learning models. Leveraging three different student feedback datasets, I built and evaluated models such as Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 90.15%. The insights were deployed via a web application that visualizes instructor performance metrics and predictions.

Key Features:
- Cross-dataset performance analysis
- Model accuracy evaluation and comparison
- Deployed using Streamlit for public access

Skills & Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit, Supervised Learning
